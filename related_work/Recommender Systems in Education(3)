Recommender system has been successfully used in many industries, such as e-commerce [15], job search [28], and content streaming [29, 30]. It is also considered an important tool for improving personalised learning experiences in the field of education [31, 32]. The three main recommendation techniques are Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid approach. Collaborative Filtering (CF) leverages interactions between users and items to generate recommendations [34] and is divided into two approaches: memory-based and model-based [33]. The memory-based collaborative filtering utilises past user interactions to compute similarities, which can be either among users based on the items they have an interaction with (user-based approach) or among items based on the users who have an interaction with them (item-based approach) [42]. The model-based collaborative filtering uses user preferences to create a training model, extracts features from existing data using statistical or machine learning methods and calculates predictive scores on the model to make recommendations [41]. This approach includes techniques such as matrix factorisation [44], neural networks [46] and clustering algorithms [45]. Liu et al. [43] applied a user-based collaborative filtering model to generate recommendations for courses by evaluating user similarities, which can support students in choosing courses and Kusumawardhani et al. [36] implemented a book recommendation system employing item-based collaborative filtering, which assessed the similarity between books by analysing their characteristics. Additionally, Jin et al. [35] suggested recommending educational exercises and tasks that stimulate students' enthusiasm and enable them to realise their full potential. They achieved this by considering the learners' current knowledge state to match appropriate tasks and utilising Singular Value Decomposition which is a model-based collaborative filtering method. However, one of the primary challenges in recommender systems, particularly in collaborative filtering models, is the cold-start problem [37]. This problem arises when the system encounters new items or users with no prior interaction history. Content-Based Filtering matches the preferences of users with the features of items [38]. Kusuma and Musdholifah [39] designed a thesis topic recommendation system using content-based filtering. This system collected students' interests in courses and their grades, compared the content of research publications with course descriptions, and recommended publications that align with both the students' interests and their abilities. However, content-based filtering models also face the cold-start problem [40].
