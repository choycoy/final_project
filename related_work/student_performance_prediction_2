Student performance indicates students' progress or achievement in their learning activities and is utilised to evaluate their skills, comprehension of concepts and knowledge [16]. 
Predicting student performance is necessary to identify students who could face challenges and intervene early to offer them timely support, personalised learning strategies, and resources to enhance their chances of success. There are primarily two methods for performance prediction: Knowledge Tracing and Educational Data Mining. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is the process of estimating a student's mastery level of a concept by analysing their past performance on related learning tasks [9], i.e., KT aims to predict if the student will give an accurate response to the upcoming question. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) [11] was the most popular method to model students' knowledge states and each of them was expressed as a binary variable to specify whether a student achieved mastery or not in the learning concept [10]. Several extensions of BKT were suggested by including additional aspects such as exercise difficulty [12] and individual student characteristics [13]. Another common category of traditional Knowledge Tracing methods is factor analysis model which focuses on learning general parameters from past data to predict [17]. For instance, Item Response Theory (IRT) [25] involves parameters related to the ability of student and the level of question’s difficulty, Performance Factor Analysis (PFA) [26] includes analysing student’s positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) responses to questions, and Addictive Factors Analysis Model (AFM) [27] includes elapsed time per individual step. With the advancement of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) [19] applies Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to track student’s knowledge state and calculates the probability that students will provide correct answers to questions in accordance with their levels of knowledge.
