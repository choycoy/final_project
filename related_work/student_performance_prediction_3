Student performance indicates student’s progress or achievement in their learning activities and is utilised to evaluate their comprehension of concepts, skills and knowledge [16]. Predicting student performance is necessary to identify students who could face challenges, allowing for early intervention to offer them timely support, personalised learning strategies, and resources to enhance their chances of success. There are primarily two methods for performance prediction: Knowledge Tracing and Educational Data Mining. Knowledge Tracing (KT) estimates students’ mastery level of a concept by analysing their past performance on related learning tasks [9], i.e., KT aims to predict if they will give an accurate response to the upcoming question. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) [11] was the most popular method for modelling students’ knowledge states, with each of these states being expressed as a binary variable to indicate whether they achieved mastery or not in the learning concept. Several extensions of BKT were suggested by including additional aspects such as exercise difficulty [12] and individual student’s characteristics [13]. Another common category of traditional Knowledge Tracing methods is factor analysis model which focuses on learning general parameters from past data to predict [17]. For instance, in order to forecast student performance, Addictive Factors Analysis Model (AFM) [27] considered students’ response times that could offer insights into the correctness of their answers and DAS3H [10] suggested encoding the question’s difficulty, student’s ability, skills and skill practice history. With the advancement of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) [19] applied Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to track student’s knowledge state and calculated the probability that they would provide correct answers to questions in accordance with their levels of knowledge.
