Student performance indicates students' progress or achievement in their learning activities and is utilised to evaluate their skills, comprehension of concepts and knowledge [16]. Predicting student performance is necessary to identify students who could face challenges and intervene early to offer them timely support, personalised learning strategies, and resources to enhance their chances of success. There are primarily two methods for performance prediction: Knowledge Tracing and conventional machine learning approach [1]. 
Knowledge Tracing (KT) is the process of estimating a student's mastery level of a concept by analysing their past performance on related learning tasks [9], i.e., KT aims to predict if the student will provide a correct answer to the upcoming question. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) [11] was the most popular method to model students' knowledge states and each of them was expressed as a binary variable to specify whether a student had achieved mastery or not in the learning concept [10]. Several extensions of BKT were suggested by including additional aspects such as exercise difficulty [12] and individual student characteristics [13]. Another common category of traditional Knowledge Tracing methods is factor analysis model. Based on the Factorisation Machine approach, diverse features including questions and concepts are employed to make predictions regarding studentsâ€™ performance [17]. Furthermore, Ability Boosted Knowledge Tracing (ABKT) [18] introduces the factor of ability into the attribution of learning feedback, allowing the model to concurrently analyse the learning process from two viewpoints: knowledge and ability.
