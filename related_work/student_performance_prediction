There are primarily two methods for performance prediction: Knowledge Tracing and  conventional machine learning approach [1]. Knowledge Tracing models students' progression in mastering skills and concepts by tracking their knowledge states during a sequence of learning activities [9]. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) [11] was the most popular method to model students' knowledge states and each of them was expressed as a binary variable to specify whether a student had achieved mastery or not in the learning concept [10]. Several extensions of BKT were suggested by including additional aspects such as exercise difficulty [12] and individual student characteristics [13]. However, two main drawbacks commonly found in many existing knowledge tracing models are as follows: (1) They do not consider the continuous-score scenarios since they treat student answers as a binary value [14] and (2) all students are assumed to have the equal initial knowledge levels and learning rate for any given skill, not reflecting individual studentâ€™s learning ability [15].
