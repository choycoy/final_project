Recommender system has been successfully used in many industries, such as e-commerce [15], job search [28], and content streaming [29, 30]. It is also considered as an important tool for improving personalised learning experiences in the field of education [31, 32]. The four main recommendation techniques are Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Knowledge-Based approach, and Hybrid approach [33]. Collaborative Filtering leverages interactions between users and items to generate recommendations [34].
