2.1  Adaptive Learning Environments
Adaptive learning aims to personalise the learning process by dynamically adapting to the learner's interactions and input [4]. For instance, [2] proposes an adaptive exercise generation method in online language learning that combines students’ evolving knowledge progress with their current knowledge level and instructor’s preferences to boost learning efficiency. Adaptive learning can be classified into three different research directions [8]: (1) a content model, domain model, which focuses on the modelling of learning materials and it commonly applies natural language processing [3] and data mining [5] to comprehend and compare resources, (2) a learner model, student model, which repeatedly evaluates and updates students’ characteristics [2] and includes learner’s attributes, proficiency, knowledge, preferences, emotional or motivational aspects of learner’s behaviour, and individual differences which are used to customise the learning experience [6], and (3) an instructional model, pedagogical model, which indicates the algorithm that helps adapt the instruction based on the content and learner model [7]. For example, recommendations for the next learning item or the design of a suitable learning path can be made by considering the performance history of students, knowledge states and candidate learning materials [8]. In this study, the learner model is built based on the student’s performance such as the average period taken by the student to respond to a question and a measure to evaluate student accuracy in predicting answers to questions. The content and instructional model are combined into a learning model that predicts if the student answers the next question correctly and recommends the next question adaptively based on student characteristics captured by the student model.
