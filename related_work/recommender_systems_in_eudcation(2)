Recommender system has been successfully used in many industries, such as e-commerce [15], job search [28], and content streaming [29, 30]. It is also considered as an important tool for improving personalised learning experiences in the field of education [31, 32]. The four main recommendation techniques are Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Knowledge-Based approach, and Hybrid approach [33]. Collaborative Filtering (CF) leverages interactions between users and items to generate recommendations [34]. Jin et al. [35] suggested to recommend learning materials that stimulate students' enthusiasm and enable them to realise their full potential.

They achieved this by considering the learners' current knowledge state to match appropriate exercises and utilising Singular Value Decomposition which is a model-based collaborative filtering method. Additionally, Muzdybayeva et al. [36] employed collaborative filtering through matrix factorisation to propose a personalised course recommendation system. This recommendation system was developed by analysing data related to students' past academic achievements, preferences, and objectives. However, one of the primary challenges in recommender systems, particularly in collaborative filtering models, is the cold-start problem [37]. This problem arises when the system encounters new items or users with no prior interaction history. Content-Based Filtering matches the preferences of users with the features of items [38].
