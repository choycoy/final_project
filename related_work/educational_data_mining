On the other hand, educational data mining has been used to make predictions about student’s learning outcomes [20, 22, 23]. Using various machine learning methods, educational data mining can extract key information regarding academic achievements of students [15]. For example, Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression were employed to anticipate the graduation results of engineering students based on their performance in the first three years [14] and Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour and Neural Networks were utilised to predict undergraduate student dropout [25].
